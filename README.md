# reactChat
experiment to test out react with socket.io and regular http connections.

### Remaining Finishing Touches
1. Move socket listeners to app.js
2. change state to an array of rooms ordered by message date
   1. that way we can change the order of rooms depending on last message
3. Create Rooms
4. Search for Rooms
5. Add user to room
6. join room
7. change casing of css to kebob-case
8. change room components to minimized circles/images for mobile view
9. change addMessage from text area to input?
   1.  I want a growing input area but also send message on 'enter'
